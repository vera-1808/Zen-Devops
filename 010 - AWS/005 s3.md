We’ll eventually take an in-depth look at the S3 service. But before we get to that, let’s have a look at how things were before we had the option of using Amazon S3. 

## What is AWS S3?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides object storage, which is built for storing and recovering any amount of information or data from anywhere over the internet. It provides this storage through a web services interface. While designed for developers for easier web-scale computing, it provides 99.999999999 percent durability and 99.99 percent availability of objects. It can also store computer files up to 5 terabytes in size.


1. S3 stores data as objects within buckets.

2. An object consists of a file and optionally any metadata that describes that file.

3. A key is a unique identifier for an object within a bucket.

4. Storage capacity is virtually unlimited.

## Before AWS S3

Organizations had a difficult time finding, storing, and managing all of your data. Not only that, running applications, delivering content to customers, hosting high traffic websites, or backing up emails and other files required a lot of storage. Maintaining the organization’s repository was also expensive and time-consuming for several reasons. Challenges included the following:

1. Having to purchase hardware and software components

2. Requiring a team of experts for maintenance

3. A lack of scalability based on your requirements

4. Data security requirements

These are the issues AWS S3 would eventually solve. So, what exactly is AWS S3? 

## AWS S3 Benefits

Some of the benefits of AWS S3 are: 

+ Durability:  S3 provides 99.999999999 percent durability.

+ Low cost: S3 lets you store data in a range of “storage classes.” These classes are based on the frequency and immediacy you require in accessing files. 

+ Scalability: S3 charges you only for what resources you actually use, and there are no hidden fees or overage charges. You can scale your storage resources to easily meet your organization’s ever-changing demands.

+ Availability: S3 offers 99.99 percent availability of objects

+ Security: S3 offers an impressive range of access management tools and encryption features that provide top-notch security.

+ Flexibility: S3 is ideal for a wide range of uses like data storage, data backup, software delivery, data archiving, disaster recovery, website hosting, mobile applications, IoT devices, and much more.

+ Simple data transfer: You don’t have to be an IT genius to execute data transfers on S3. The service revolves around simplicity and ease of use.

These are compelling reasons to sign up for S3. Now, let’s move on and have

## AWS Buckets and Objects

An object consists of data, key (assigned name), and metadata. A bucket is used to store objects. When data is added to a bucket, Amazon S3 creates a unique version ID and allocates it to the object.

## How Does Amazon S3 work?

Like we saw in the example above, first off, a user creates a bucket. When this bucket is created, the user will specify the region in which the bucket is deployed. Later, when files are uploaded to the bucket, the user will determine the type of S3 storage class to be used for those specific objects. After this, users can define features to the bucket, such as bucket policy, lifecycle policies, versioning control, etc.

Now, let’s talk about the different storage classes offered by Amazon S3.

## What is AWS S3: Amazon S3 Storage Classes

Let’s have a look at the different storage classes using the example of a school:

1. Amazon S3 Standard for frequent data access: Suitable for a use case where the latency should below. Example: Frequently accessed data will be the data of students’ attendance, which should be retrieved quickly.

2. Amazon S3 Standard for infrequent data access: Can be used where the data is long-lived and less frequently accessed. Example: Students’ academic records will not be needed daily, but if they have any requirement, their details should be retrieved quickly.

3. Amazon Glacier: Can be used where the data has to be archived, and high performance is not required. Example: Ex-student’s old record (like admission fee) will not be needed daily, and even if it is necessary, low latency is not required.

4. One Zone-IA Storage Class: It can be used where the data is infrequently accessed and stored in a single region. Example: Student’s report card is not used daily and stored in a single availability region (i.e., school).

5.  Amazon S3 Standard Reduced Redundancy storage: Suitable for a use case where the data is non-critical and reproduced quickly. Example: Books in the library are non-critical data and can be replaced if lost.

Let’s now have a look at the different features offered by S3.

## AWS S3 Features
   LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT

In lifecycle management, Amazon S3 applies a set of rules that define the action to a group of objects. You can manage and store objects in a cost-effective manner. There are two types of actions: 

1. Transition Action

With this action, you can choose to move objects to another storage class. With this, you can configure S3 to move your data between various storage classes on a defined schedule. Assume you’ve got some data stored in the S3 standard class. If this data is not used frequently for 30 days, it would be moved to the S3 infrequent access class. And after 60 days, it is moved to Glacier. This helps you to migrate your data to lower-cost storage as it ages automatically. 

2. Expiration Actions

Here, S3 removes all objects within the bucket when a specified date or time period in the object’s lifetime is reached.

An example of how lifecycle management works:

# BUCKET POLICY

bucket policy is an IAM policy where you can allow or deny permission to your Amazon S3 resources. With bucket policy, you also define security rules that apply to more than one file within a bucket. For example: If you do not want a user to access the “Simplilearn” bucket, then with the help of JSON script, you can set permissions. As a result, a user would be denied access to the bucket.


<img src="https://github.com/Gitscooby/Images/blob/main/s3%20image%2018.png">


 Use an online tool to generate a policy. Select the type of policy as an S3 bucket policy. Select the appropriate effect. In this case, denying access.

Go back to the bucket and set up a bucket policy under “Permissions.” Then click on “Save.”


+ **Scalability and Durability:** S3 is designed to scale automatically, allowing you to store and retrieve any amount of data. It provides 99.999999999% durability, meaning that data is highly resistant to loss.


+ **Bucket-based Storage:** S3 uses a bucket-based model to organize data. Each bucket acts as a top-level container for objects (files) within S3. You can create multiple buckets, and each bucket has a globally unique name.


+ **Object Storage:** S3 stores objects, which can range in size from a few bytes to terabytes. Objects consist of data, a unique key, and metadata (optional). The key is used to retrieve objects from a bucket, and metadata provides information about the object (e.g., content type, creation date).


+ **Data Consistency:** S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for all object updates. This means that once you write an object, you can immediately read it and receive the latest version.

+ **Access Control:** S3 offers several mechanisms to control access to your data. You can use bucket policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to manage permissions at the bucket and object level.



+ **Data Transfer Acceleration:** S3 supports data transfer acceleration using the AWS Global Accelerator. It speeds up the content delivery by leveraging Amazon's edge locations and optimized network paths.

+ **Versioning:** S3 supports versioning, allowing you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket. This feature is useful for data backup, auditing, and maintaining historical changes.

+ **Server-side Encryption:** S3 provides built-in encryption mechanisms to secure your data at rest. You can choose to use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys or use S3-managed keys.


+ **Lifecycle Management:** S3 offers lifecycle policies that automate the transition of objects between storage classes or enable object expiration. This helps optimize storage costs based on your data access patterns.

+ **Event Notifications:** S3 can trigger events (e.g., object creation, deletion) and send notifications to other AWS services like Lambda, SNS, or SQS. This allows you to build event-driven architectures and automate workflows.


+ **Cross-Region Replication:** S3 supports automatic replication of objects between different AWS regions. This feature provides data redundancy and enables disaster recovery strategies.

+ **Multipart Upload:** For large objects, S3 allows you to upload them in parts, making it easier to handle network issues and resume interrupted uploads. It also enables parallel uploads, improving upload performance.


+ **Query-in-Place with Amazon Athena:** S3 integrates with Amazon Athena, a serverless query service, allowing you to run SQL queries directly on your data stored in S3 without the need for data movement or transformation.

+ **Access Logs and Monitoring:** S3 can log detailed access logs that capture requests made to your bucket. Additionally"
